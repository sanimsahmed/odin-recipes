# odin-recipes
Welcome to my very first HTML website and project. My motivation behind starting the Odin Project (TOP) was to finally learn something new and further expand my skills, which has led me to this point. I hope that this has demonstrated my newfound skills in HTML and Git while still showing room for improvement, because I've only just started.

In this project I created a website that contains recipes. At the moment, I only have 3 recipes, but that may be subject to change. Additionally, the original link to each recipe is at the bottom of each recipe page. What I wanted to do in this website was implement everything that I've learned about HTML through the various TOP lessons. Since I haven't gotten to the CSS and javascript lessons, I tried my best to remember everything from bold tags to line breaks to images.

Like any HTML project, if you want to open it up you can double click on the index.html file to get to the homepage. Additionally, you can see the preview by going on sanimsahmed.github.io/odin-recipes.
